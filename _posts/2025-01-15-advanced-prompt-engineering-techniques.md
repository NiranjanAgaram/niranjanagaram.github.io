# Advanced Prompt Engineering: Techniques I've Learned from 6 Months with LLMs

Six months ago, my prompts looked like this: "Write a Python function to analyze data." Now they look like this: "You are a senior data engineer with 10 years of experience. Write a Python function that analyzes patient readmission data, following these specific requirements..." 

The difference? About 80% improvement in output quality.

Here's what I've learned about prompt engineering that actually works in production.

## The Evolution of My Prompting

### Phase 1: Basic Requests (Terrible Results)
```
"Create a data pipeline for patient data"
```
**Result**: Generic code that didn't work with our data structure.

### Phase 2: More Specific (Better, But Still Generic)
```
"Create a Python data pipeline that reads CSV files, cleans the data, and loads it into PostgreSQL"
```
**Result**: Working code, but required significant modifications.

### Phase 3: Context-Rich Prompting (Actually Useful)
```
You are a healthcare data engineer working with HIPAA-compliant patient data.

Context:
- Input: Daily CSV files with patient demographics and visit data
- Data issues: Missing values, inconsistent date formats, duplicate records
- Output: Clean data in PostgreSQL with proper indexing
- Constraints: Must handle 100K+ records, include error logging

Requirements:
1. Validate data quality before processing
2. Handle common healthcare data issues (null DOBs, invalid gender codes)
3. Include comprehensive error handling and logging
4. Follow HIPAA compliance patterns

Create a production-ready Python pipeline with these specifications.
```
**Result**: Code that worked with minimal modifications.

## The Techniques That Actually Work

### 1. Role-Based Prompting

Instead of asking an AI to "write code," I give it a specific professional identity:

```
You are a senior ML engineer at a healthcare company with expertise in:
- Production model deployment
- Healthcare data compliance (HIPAA)
- MLOps best practices
- Python and TensorFlow

Your task is to...
```

This consistently produces more professional, context-aware responses.

### 2. The STAR Method for Complex Tasks

I adapted the interview technique for prompts:

**Situation**: What's the business context?
**Task**: What exactly needs to be done?
**Action**: What approach should be taken?
**Result**: What should the outcome look like?

```
Situation: Our hospital needs to predict patient readmissions to reduce costs and improve care.

Task: Build a machine learning model that predicts 30-day readmission risk using patient demographics, diagnosis codes, and historical visit data.

Action: Use Python with scikit-learn, implement proper cross-validation, handle class imbalance, and include feature importance analysis.

Result: A production-ready model with >75% precision, comprehensive evaluation metrics, and clear documentation for clinical staff.

Build this solution step by step.
```

### 3. Constraint-Driven Prompting

I learned to be explicit about limitations and requirements:

```
Build a real-time data processing system with these constraints:
- Budget: Must use open-source tools only
- Scale: Handle 10K events per second
- Latency: <100ms processing time
- Infrastructure: Single server with 16GB RAM
- Team: Junior developers will maintain this
- Compliance: Must log all data access for audits

Do NOT suggest solutions that violate these constraints.
```

### 4. Few-Shot Learning with Domain Examples

For healthcare-specific tasks, I provide examples from our actual work:

```
I need help writing SQL queries for healthcare analytics. Here are examples of our data structure and query patterns:

Example 1:
Table: patient_visits
Query: Find average length of stay by department
SELECT department, AVG(DATEDIFF(discharge_date, admit_date)) as avg_los
FROM patient_visits 
WHERE discharge_date IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY department;

Example 2:
Table: lab_results
Query: Find patients with abnormal glucose levels
SELECT DISTINCT patient_id, test_date, result_value
FROM lab_results 
WHERE test_name = 'Glucose' AND (result_value > 140 OR result_value < 70);

Now write a query to: Find patients with multiple emergency visits in the last 30 days.
```

### 5. Chain-of-Thought for Complex Problems

For multi-step problems, I explicitly ask for reasoning:

```
I need to design a data architecture for real-time patient monitoring. 

Think through this step by step:
1. What are the data sources and their characteristics?
2. What are the processing requirements and constraints?
3. What technologies would best fit these requirements?
4. What are the potential failure points and how to handle them?
5. How would you implement monitoring and alerting?

Provide your reasoning for each step, then give the final architecture recommendation.
```

## Domain-Specific Prompting Patterns

### Healthcare Data Analysis
```
You are analyzing healthcare data with these considerations:
- Patient privacy (HIPAA compliance)
- Clinical significance of findings
- Statistical rigor for medical decisions
- Regulatory reporting requirements

When analyzing [specific dataset], ensure you:
1. Check for data quality issues common in healthcare
2. Apply appropriate statistical tests for medical data
3. Interpret results in clinical context
4. Flag any findings that need medical expert review
```

### Production System Design
```
Design this system for production deployment:

Non-functional requirements:
- 99.9% uptime SLA
- Handle 10x current load
- <2 second response time
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Comprehensive monitoring
- Cost-effective scaling

Technical constraints:
- Existing PostgreSQL database
- Kubernetes infrastructure
- Python/FastAPI stack
- Limited budget for new tools

Provide architecture with specific technology choices and rationale.
```

## The Mistakes I Made (And How to Avoid Them)

### 1. Being Too Vague About Output Format

**Bad**: "Analyze this data and give me insights"
**Good**: "Analyze this data and provide: 1) Summary statistics table, 2) Top 3 insights with supporting evidence, 3) Recommended actions with business impact estimates, 4) Python code to reproduce the analysis"

### 2. Not Specifying Error Handling

**Bad**: "Write a function to process files"
**Good**: "Write a function to process files with error handling for: missing files, corrupted data, network timeouts, disk space issues. Include logging and graceful degradation."

### 3. Ignoring Maintenance and Documentation

**Bad**: "Create a machine learning model"
**Good**: "Create a machine learning model with: comprehensive docstrings, unit tests, configuration management, model versioning, and deployment instructions for junior developers"

## Advanced Techniques I'm Experimenting With

### 1. Persona Switching Within Prompts

```
First, as a data scientist, evaluate this model's performance metrics.
Then, as a software engineer, review the code quality and maintainability.
Finally, as a business stakeholder, assess the practical value and implementation feasibility.
```

### 2. Adversarial Prompting for Robustness

```
Build a data validation system for patient records.

Then, act as a malicious user trying to break this system. What edge cases, invalid inputs, or attack vectors could cause problems?

Finally, update the system to handle these issues.
```

### 3. Iterative Refinement Prompts

```
Create a basic version of [system].
Now identify the top 3 weaknesses in this implementation.
Improve the system to address these weaknesses.
Repeat this process 2 more times.
```

## Measuring Prompt Effectiveness

I track these metrics for my prompts:

1. **First-try success rate**: How often does the output work without modifications?
2. **Modification time**: How long to fix issues in the generated code?
3. **Code quality**: Does it follow best practices and include proper error handling?
4. **Completeness**: Does it address all requirements without follow-up prompts?

**My current stats**:
- First-try success: 75% (up from 20% six months ago)
- Average modification time: 15 minutes (down from 2 hours)
- Code quality: Consistently includes error handling and documentation
- Completeness: 90% of requirements met in first response

## Tools and Workflows

### My Current Setup
- **Primary LLM**: GPT-4 for complex tasks, GPT-3.5 for simple ones
- **Backup**: Claude for different perspectives on complex problems
- **Prompt Management**: I maintain a personal library of proven prompt templates
- **Testing**: I test prompts on sample problems before using them for real work

### Prompt Templates I Use Daily

**Code Review Template**:
```
Review this [language] code as a senior engineer:

Code:
[code here]

Evaluate:
1. Correctness and logic
2. Performance and efficiency
3. Security vulnerabilities
4. Maintainability and readability
5. Best practices adherence

Provide specific improvement suggestions with examples.
```

**Architecture Design Template**:
```
Design a system architecture for: [problem description]

Requirements: [functional requirements]
Constraints: [technical/business constraints]
Scale: [performance requirements]

Provide:
1. High-level architecture diagram (text description)
2. Technology stack with rationale
3. Data flow description
4. Scalability considerations
5. Potential risks and mitigation strategies
```

## What's Next

I'm exploring:
1. **Multi-modal prompting**: Combining text, code, and diagrams
2. **Prompt chaining**: Breaking complex tasks into connected prompts
3. **Custom fine-tuning**: Training models on our specific domain data
4. **Automated prompt optimization**: Using AI to improve my prompts

## Key Takeaways

1. **Context is everything**: The more relevant context you provide, the better the output
2. **Be specific about constraints**: LLMs need boundaries to produce practical solutions
3. **Examples are powerful**: Show the AI what good looks like in your domain
4. **Iterate and measure**: Track what works and refine your approach
5. **Think like a teacher**: You're teaching the AI about your specific problem domain

Prompt engineering isn't just about getting AI to work—it's about getting AI to work well for your specific use case. The techniques that work for generic tutorials often fail in production environments with real constraints and requirements.
